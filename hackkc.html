            <p>Part of the <a href="http://hackforchange.org/">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, HackKC brings together urbanists, hackers,
                government staff, developers, designers, community organizers and regular people 
                to collaborate in building new solutions using publicly-released data,
                open technology and design processes.</p>

            <p>Frustrated with traditional hackathons? Hack KC starts with a two-day event, but we plan for projects to
                continue through the fall. Code for KC will support your team and help you create a great civic
                project.</p>

            <p>We have a few projects planned, but need your ideas, too!  We have already engaged Historic Kansas City, the City of KCMO, Community Capital Fund and others willing to support our projects. We just need coders like you to lend a hand and a day or two to bring these ideas (and others) to life! 

Here are some examples of apps we can build together:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt> N-Hood</dt><dd>Build an app to help neighborhood leaders and members to use 
                    information to keep everyone aware of changes and to solve problems. For example, what businesses are 
                    opening or closing? What building demolitions are planned? What upcoming construction projects will 
                    affect the neighborhood?  Is your street going to be closed for repairs?

                <dt>Zoning - Parcel Assessment Tool</dt><dd>P.A.T. is designed to allow those with an interest in 
                    real estate to quickly assess if a piece of land is suitable for their project.  The P.A.T.'s GIS 
                    system allows users to pinpoint locations, access the current zoning information for the space, then 
                    perform calculations to determine the specifications of an appropriate building.</dd>
